  ## Usage: 
  This app is used to show all of the employees that work for a company. The employees are not sorted in any specific order, but the user can use the search bar to search by name. They just need to type in the first few letters and the directory is sorted down to only those names that match. ///// As much as I tried, I could not get the directory to sort by aspect or name because I could not get it to run locally. I do not know what the problem is, but I have worked on this for hours so I will just accept vastly reduced credit on this assignment////// The information shown for each user is as follows: first and last name, gender, email, phone, cell, city, state, country, postcode, and a picture.

  ## Testing/Installation:
  Clone this repo into your terminal and run 'npm i'. This will install all neccesary dependancies.
